You are an expert presentation designer. Generate a professional and visually engaging slide deck (in Markdown format) for a university project presentation about a web application called "CodeVerse".

The presentation should be clear, concise, and targeted at an audience of professors and fellow students. It should cover the project's motivation, technology, features, and future scope.

Here is the structure and content for each slide:

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Title:** CodeVerse: A Gamified, AI-Enhanced Platform for Modern Programming Education
*   **Subtitle:** PS1 Project Presentation
*   **Presenter Name:** [Your Name]
*   **Course/Department:** [Your Course/Department Name]
*   **University Logo:** [Placeholder for your university logo]

### **Slide 2: The Problem**
*   **Title:** The Challenge of Learning to Code
*   **Key Points (use icons for each):**
    *   **Passive Learning:** Traditional video tutorials lack interaction.
    *   **Lack of Feedback:** Beginners struggle without immediate, personalized guidance.
    *   **Low Engagement:** The steep learning curve can be demotivating.
*   **Central Question:** How can we make learning to code more engaging, interactive, and effective?

### **Slide 3: Our Solution: Introducing CodeVerse**
*   **Title:** CodeVerse: Learn, Play, Conquer
*   **Core Concept:** A web platform that merges interactive learning with gamification and AI-powered tutoring.
*   **Visual:** A central screenshot of the CodeVerse homepage.
*   **Three Pillars (as icons below the screenshot):**
    *   Interactive Courses
    *   Gamified Playground
    *   AI-Powered Assistance

### **Slide 4: System Architecture & Tech Stack**
*   **Title:** Built on a Modern Foundation
*   **Content:** A simplified architecture diagram showing the relationship between the three main components:
    1.  **Frontend (Next.js & React):** User Interface, Pages, Components.
    2.  **Backend (Supabase):** PostgreSQL Database, User Authentication, File Storage.
    3.  **AI Layer (Google Genkit):** AI Flows, Connection to Gemini Models.
*   **Logos:** Display logos for Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and Google AI (Genkit/Gemini).

### **Slide 5: Feature Deep Dive: Gamified Learning**
*   **Title:** The Playground: Where Practice Meets Play
*   **Visual:** A screenshot of the Code Bubble game in action.
*   **Key Mechanics:**
    *   **Objective:** Construct correct code by "shooting" code bubbles.
    *   **AI-Generated Distractors:** Incorrect code bubbles are dynamically created by an AI to challenge the player.
    *   **Progression:** Earn XP for completing levels, which is saved to your user profile.

---

### **Slide 6: Feature Deep Dive: AI-Powered Assistance**
*   **Title:** Your Personal AI Coding Tutor
*   **Content:** Showcase the different AI features with small icons.
    *   **AI Code Review:** Get playful, constructive feedback on your practice code.
    *   **Code Explainer:** Instantly demystify complex code snippets with simple explanations.
    *   **AI Chat:** A floating chat widget is available site-wide for any questions.
    *   **AI Content Generation (for Admins):** Automatically generate course descriptions.

---

### **Slide 7: The Development Process: A Human-AI Collaboration**
*   **Title:** How CodeVerse Was Built
*   **Core Idea:** This project was developed in partnership with an AI coding assistant.
*   **Process Flow (as a simple diagram):**
    1.  **Idea (Human):** "I need a dashboard for users."
    2.  **Prompt (Human):** Write a detailed request in natural language.
    3.  **Code Generation (AI):** The AI generates the complete code for the UI, backend logic, and database queries.
    4.  **Test & Refine (Human + AI):** The developer tests the feature and asks the AI to fix any bugs or make adjustments.
*   **Benefit:** Massively accelerated development time, allowing focus on high-level architecture and features.

---

### **Slide 8: Live Demonstration**
*   **Title:** Live Demo
*   **Content:** (This slide is a placeholder for your live demonstration)
*   **Key points to demonstrate:**
    *   Show the main dashboard and course catalog.
    *   Walk through a topic page and use the "Explain Code" feature.
    *   Play one level of the "Code Bubble" game to show the mechanics.
    *   Use the floating AI chat widget to ask a simple question.

---

### **Slide 9: Conclusion & Future Work**
*   **Title:** Summary and What's Next
*   **Conclusion:** CodeVerse successfully demonstrates a model for a highly engaging, AI-enhanced learning platform. It validates the potential of human-AI collaboration in rapid software development.
*   **Future Work:**
    *   **Adaptive Learning Paths:** AI adjusts level difficulty based on user performance.
    *   **Full AI Course Generation:** Create entire courses from a single topic prompt.
    *   **Multiplayer Challenges:** Introduce head-to-head coding games.
